A priori the SAS software (ImproveSAS) was used to create the routines, however, the secondary aim of the project is to expand ImproveStats routines for other modern programming languages oriented to statistics, e.g (R (ImproveR), Python (ImprovePython), etc.) and put the routines in the largest public site of routines in the world <http://improvestats.github.io/>.\r\n\r\nOver time biometric models applied to phenotypic data and genomic molecular evolve, so it is important to the researcher/breeder having updated tools to facilitate statistical analysis. \r\n* The interesting thing about a programming language is that in this case is possible to manage a large volume of data.\r\n* The second benefit of using a programming language to do statistical analysis, is that we have more control over each step performed with the experimental data. \r\n* The third benefit using programming language is to implement updated biometric models published in high-impact articles or even create new models applied to data.\r\n* The fourth benefit is that you learn a lot of statistics!.  \r\n\r\n***\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages or suggestions? contact support **jalles10@gmail.com** and we’ll help you sort it out.","google":"UA-69494005-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
